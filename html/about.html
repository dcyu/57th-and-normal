        <p>In the early 2000s transportation company Norfolk Southern initiated an expansion of its 47th Street Terminal on Chicago's South Side by covertly buying property in the nearby Englewood neighborhood.  Since plans were publicized in September 2011, the neighborhood has been thrown into chaos.</p> 

        <p>The Area (working title) is a feature-length documentary by David Schalliol that explores the neighborhood and its confrontation with the pressures of contemporary transportation policy by following neighborhood residents as they are living on borrowed time, maintaining friendships and traditions while struggling with new problems in their vanishing community.</p>

        <p>Watch a 9-minute short film of The Area from February 2013 here.</p>

        <p>On this website you can also find an interactive timeline showing the continued progress of Norfolk Southern's acquisitions in the area, presented for the historical record and as a community resource - click here to view.</p>

        <p>Norfolk Southern's steady buyout of the 57th & Normal area has occurred in a neighborhood wracked by the ongoing national housing crisis -- underwater mortgages, foreclosures, and vacant properties breeding dereliction and crime.  Reactions to this inevitable migration have been varied, from despair and organized resistance, to excitement at a platform to move out to a safer neighborhood or a better life.  But more often than not, residents were kept ill-informed and have perceived the sales of their homes as deeply undervalued.  Neighbors are wrestling to comprehend gravity of their individual and collective losses, and discovering new ways of living a good life and connecting with community in the face of uncertainty.  While many aspects of life quality across neighborhoods can be measured or compared, the loss of decades of strong community ties and family memories cannot be.  And tragically, one young former resident has already lost her life, as her move out of 57th & Normal crossed contested gang lines, an innocent bystander to unhinged violence.</p>

        <p>The recent experiences of the neighborhood fit into a long history of the displacement of thousands of people in Chicago by public works and transportation projects -- by the construction of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle Campus, the Dan Ryan and Eisenhower expressways, O'Hare airport, and during both the building and tearing down of high-rise public housing, to name a few examples -- a history of top-down calculations made in favor of rapid development, with stark divisions among those who would receive its benefits and those who pay its costs.  The South side of the city has always served as a major rail transport and infrastructure hub, and is currently undergoing several other similar expansions, such as recent CREATE (Chicago Region Environmental & Transport Efficiency) program undertakings and Metra's Englewood Flyover project.  Yet unlike those public-private partnerships, the removal of the 57th & Normal neighborhood involves no associated governmental agency, and decision-making has proceeded entirely behind closed doors.  Residents have watched the demolition of entire blocks over the course of the past two years without even knowing of the rail expansion project underlying the process.</p>

        <p>During the acquisition of the approximately 400 homes comprising the space of the new railyard around 57th & Normal, Norfolk Southern claims to have only made legal and willing purchases, yet one can hardly imagine such a rapid and quiet transfer of property occurring in a less-distressed area of Chicago.  Ultimately, we are all indicted by our demand for the consumer products which freight shipping brings us from coastal ports, and our desire to find them on store shelves at the moment we require them, in a world of global trade that affords such possibilities.  This project observes some of the real-life scenarios that emerge from the effects of the uneven distribution of power during an economic shift.</p>

        <p>The Area (working title) is currently in production, and will continue through the completion of the neighborhood's transition into an intermodal freight yard.  The film highlights the experience of several residents during and after their relocation, and pays careful attention to the processes of change to the landscape and social arrangements within the area, as a struggling but once-complete Chicago neighborhood - with its own culture, architecture, and history - slowly becomes urban prairie.</p>

        <p>57thandnormal.com is an online resource under development, to memorialize the 57th & Normal area for everyone, and ensure it is never forgotten.  Mapping The Paper Trail is the first of several online tools offered to comprehend the processes that have taken place in the neighborhood.</p>
